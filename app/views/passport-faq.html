          in. If you are unable to trace the record you can still apply for a certificate however
          there will be an additional administration charge if a GRO index reference is not provided.</p></li>

        and 1984 up to two years ago in England and Wales. Alternative index sources include

        and you will need to follow our telephone ordering process which incurs an additional fee

      <p>Portable Document Format (PDF) is a file format used to present and exchange documents reliably and in a
        manner that is independent of user's software, hardware, or operating system. PDF's are available for
        historical digitised civil registration records held by GRO (birth entries from 1837 to 1923 and death
        entries from 1837 to 1957). Orders for a PDF copy of a registration record must be made via our online
        ordering site; <strong>this service is not available via telephone or postal applications</strong>. The
        following document provides information on how to order a PDF, what information you will require and what
