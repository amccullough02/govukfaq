        <li><p>To order a PDF or Online View digital image, you will need to provide a GRO index
          reference number. At the point of ordering, you will be taken to the GRO online indexes
          so that you can search for the reference number for the certificate that you are interested
          in. If you are unable to trace the record you can still apply for a certificate however
          there will be an additional administration charge if a GRO index reference is not provided.</p></li>
      </ul>
      <p>The GRO online indexes should be used to try and identify the index reference for: Birth
        records from 1837 to 1934, and 1984 up to two years ago. Death records from 1837 to 1957,
        and 1984 up to two years ago in England and Wales. Alternative index sources include
        https://www.freebmd.org.uk/ and the host sites.</p>
      <p><strong>You will be prompted to supply further details for more recent births and deaths
        (within the last 50 years) and marriages and civil partnerships (within the last 35 years)
        when you complete the online application form.</strong></p>
      <p>If you are unable to complete the mandatory fields, you will not be able to apply online
        and you will need to follow our telephone ordering process which incurs an additional fee
        of £4.00 Please contact us on +44(0) 300 123 1837 for further information.</p>
      <p><strong>Ordering offline (by telephone or post) only</strong></p>

        telephone or postal certificate application fee.</p>

      within the last six months and you may wish to obtain a certificate from the register office or
      church where the event was registered.</p>
    <p>This information excludes adoption certificates, as the local register office does not hold
      a copy of the Adopted Children Register. If you require further information, please contact us
